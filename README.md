# react-render-insight

Visual and embeddable tool to inspect React component re-renders in real time.

> Current phase: **PHASE 1 — Architecture design, models, and roadmap** (no full implementation yet).

## Objective

- Understand when and why components re-render.
- Analyze the impact of memoization (`React.memo`, `useCallback`, `useMemo`).
- Visualize the component tree, render frequency, and potential optimizations.
- Provide an embeddable panel (`<RenderInsightPanel />`) and a demo playground.
